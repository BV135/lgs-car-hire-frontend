# Guidelines to implement the frontend with Vite and React

Welcome to the frontend implementation of our car hire application!

This guide will explain how to set up and run the frontend using Vite and React.

You will need to implement the Spring Boot backend separately, as this guide focuses solely on the frontend aspect.

## Prerequisites
React and Vite are required to run the frontend. Make sure you have Node.js 18.20.3 and npm installed on your machine.
The CSS used for the project is Tailwind CSS.

## Steps to start the project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3046` to view the application.
6. To build the project for production, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
7. To preview the production build, run:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
